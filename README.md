# ADMM-Pruning-for-Efficient-Deep-Learning
This repository provides the official code used for final project for [INDE7342: Nonlinear Optimization](https://publications.uh.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=264007) at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/) FA2025.

This implementation is based on [A Systematic DNN Weight Pruning Framework using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/papers/Tianyun_Zhang_A_Systematic_DNN_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf).

See **code.ipynb** for instructions on how to use this project.
